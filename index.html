				<h3>My First D&D</h3>
				<p>I stumble on D&D on YOUTUBE and bought myself a starter set to try it out. The plan was to play it with kids.
        After reading through starter kit manual i realized that this is complicated even for me. So i went back online. </p>

				<h1>Our First Game</h1>
				<p>For our first game I used <b>Monster Slayers The Heroes of Hesiod</b> one shot game designed for kids from 6years and older. But I had only two players and monsters torm my players asunder. For a time I tried to reduce monster levels and it worked for some time but we needed bigger team.
           <br>We cooperated with another Dad of two and I ran the same game for four players. Four of them was enough to defeat all monsters but game itself got pretty boring and dice'y.

				<h1>A Baleful Awakening</h1>
				<p>A Baleful Awakening is an adventure with elements of survival horror that is intended to be the start of
a new campaign—or a standalone adventure.
Waking in an abandoned tomb, the party must scavenge the area for weapons and supplies in order to
survive. If they’re lucky enough, they might discover what has happened to them…and get out alive. <a href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product/276117/A-Baleful-Awakening">Direct link</a> </p>
